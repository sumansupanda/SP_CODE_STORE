# SP_CODE_STORE

Here i have share my coding journey where i am going through different types of programming language and also looking forward to explore new things with new concept. My aim is to help the people to grab the coding knowledge in a easiest way and always give my best to update this repository :) .

## C PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE :open_book:

The *c programming language* is a `genearl-purpose`, operating `system-agnostic` and `procedural language` that supports structured programming and provides `low-level` access to the system memory.

Please refer to this :point_right: [LINK](https://github.com/sumansupanda/SP_CODE_STORE/blob/main/PROGRAMMING-LANGUAGES/c_program.md "link to explore") for further exploration.

## PYTHON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE :open_book:

*Python* is an `interpreted`, `object-oriented`, `high-level programming language` with `dynamic semantics`. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.
