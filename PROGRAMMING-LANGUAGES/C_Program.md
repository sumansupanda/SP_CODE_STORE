# INTRODUCTION.

Software is a collection of programs and a program is a collection of instruction given to the computer. Development of software is a stepwise process, before developing a software number of processes are done.

The first step is to understand the *user requirments*. *Problem analysis* arises during the requirment phase of software development. Problem analysis is done for obtaining the user requirments and to *determine the input and output* of the program. For solving any problem, an `algorithm` is implemented. *Algorithm* is a sequence of steps that gives method of solving a problem. This algorithm creates the logic of program. On the basis of this algorithm, *program code* is written. Program *testing* is performed to make sure that it gives correct result. Proper *documentation* of the program should be done so that it is easier to modify or enhance the program whenever required.

## Design Methods

*Designing* is the first step for obtaining solution of a given problem. The purpose of designing is to represent solution for a system. It is difficult to design a large system because the complexity of system cannot be represented easily. Thus various methods have been evolved for designing.

1. Top-Down Design

Every system has several hierarchies of components. The top-level component represents the whole system. Top-Down design method starts from component to lowest level(bottom) component. In this design method, the system is divided into some major components. Then each major component is divided into lower level components. Similarly other components are divided till the lowest level component.

2. Bottom-Up Design

Bottom-Up design method is the reverse of Top-Down approach. It starts from the lowest-level component to the highest-level component. It first designs the basic components and from these basic components the highest level components are designed. 

3. Modular Approach

It is better to divide a large system into modules. In terms of programming, module is logically a well-defined part of program. Each module is a separate part of the program. It is easy to modify a program written with modular approach because changes in one module don't affect other modules of program. It is also easy to check bugs in the program in module level programming.

## Programming Languages

Before learning any language, it is important to know about the various types of languages and their features. The programming languages can be classified into two types-

1. Low Level Languages

The low level languages can further divided into two types-

a. Machine level language
