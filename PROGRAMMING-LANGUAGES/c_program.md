# INTRODUCTION.

Software is a collection of programs and a program is a collection of instruction given to the computer. Development of software is a stepwise process, before developing a software number of processes are done.

The first step is to understand the *user requirments*. *Problem analysis* arises during the requirment phase of software development. Problem analysis is done for obtaining the user requirments and to *determine the input and output* of the program. For solving any problem, an `algorithm` is implemented. *Algorithm* is a sequence of steps that gives method of solving a problem. This algorithm creates the logic of program. On the basis of this algorithm, *program code* is written. Program *testing* is performed to make sure that it gives correct result. Proper *documentation* of the program should be done so that it is easier to modify or enhance the program whenever required.

## Design Methods

*Designing* is the first step for obtaining solution of a given problem. The purpose of designing is to represent solution for a system. It is difficult to design a large system because the complexity of system cannot be represented easily. Thus various methods have been evolved for designing.
